Introduction
==================================

GemAct is a comprehensive **actuarial package**, based on the collective risk theory framework, that offers a comprehensive set of tools for **non-life** (re)insurance **pricing**, stochastic **claims reserving**, and **risk aggregation**.

The variety of available functionalities makes GemAct modeling very flexible and provides actuarial scientists and practitioners with a powerful tool that fits into the expanding community of **Python** programming language.

Scope
--------

* A collective risk model apparatus to price non-life (re)insurance contracts
* Extend the set of distribution available in scipy to actuarial scientists.
* Tools to estimate the loss reserves. 
* The first Python implementation of the AEP algorithm. 

Reinsurance treaties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GemAct package can be used for pricing the following reinsurance treaties and their combinations.

* Excess-of-Loss (XL).
* Reinstatements.
* Quota-share (QS).
* Deductibles. 
* Stop-loss (SL).

Computational methods for pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The computational methods offered by the GemAct package for the collective risk model computation are either simulative or non-simulative.

* Recursive method (exact computation).
* Discrete Fourier transform, via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. 
* Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation.
* Monte Carlo simulation.
