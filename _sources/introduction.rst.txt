Introduction
==================================

GEMAct is an **actuarial package**, based on the collective risk theory framework, that offers a comprehensive set of tools for **non-life** (re)insurance **pricing**, stochastic **claims reserving**, and **risk aggregation**.

The variety of available functionalities makes GEMAct modeling very flexible and provides actuarial scientists and practitioners with a powerful tool that fits into the expanding community of **Python** programming language.

Scope
--------

* A collective risk model apparatus to price non-life (re)insurance contracts.
* Extend the set of distributions available in scipy to actuarial scientists.
  GEMAct provides the first Python implementation of the (a,b,k) family.
* New copulas available to statisticians.
  The Student-T Copula cdf can be numerically approximated in GEMAct.
* Tools to estimate the loss reserves. 
* The first publicly available Python implementation of the AEP algorithm.

Reinsurance treaties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GEMAct package can be used for pricing the following reinsurance contracts and their combinations.

* Excess-of-Loss (XL) including:
    * aggregate conditions (cover and deductible),
    * reinstatements.
* Quota-share (QS).
* Stop-loss (SL).

Computational methods for pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The computational methods offered by the GEMAct package for the collective risk model computation are either simulative or non-simulative.

* Recursive method (Panjer recursion).
* Discrete Fourier transform, via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. 
* Monte Carlo simulation.
